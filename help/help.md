#### Sequence Tube Map Usage Guide
The Sequence Tube Map is used to generate visualizations of genomic sequence graphs. This guide will demonstrate how to select custom data to visualize. [You can also read this guide on Github.](https://github.com/vgteam/sequenceTubeMap/blob/master/public/help/help.md)

##### Selecting Tracks
The following procedure describes adding and updating settings of custom tracks. You can use a custom track to load your own graph file, haplotype database, or file of aligned reads.

1. From the "Data" dropdown box, select "custom (mounted files)"

2. Select the button that says "Configure Tracks".

3. Once the button is clicked on, a popup with a "+" button will be displayed. Click on this button to add tracks.

4. Select a graph, read, or haplotype track from the first dropdown. Make sure to always have at least 1 graph track. Select a data file from the list of files of that type in the second dropdown.

5. Click on the settings button, where there are options to color the tracks from an existing color palette, or select any other color.

7. To delete a track, click on the button with the "x" icon.

##### Displaying Visualizations
1. Add as many tracks as needed and exit the track picker. 
2. Add a BED file, if needed. This step is optional.

3. Specify a region input. The region input can be:
   * A coordinate range (e.g. "chr1:1-100")
   * A node ID range (e.g. "node:100-110")
   * A start position and a distance (e.g. "chr1:1+100")
   * A node ID anchor and a distance (e.g. "node:100+10")
